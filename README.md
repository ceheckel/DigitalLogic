## Overview
The file within this project are mostly Verilog files used in an educational 
setting to demonstrate the integration process of software into hardware.
Found within each file is a header that describes when the file was created, 
what it does, and briefly how it does goes about doing its task.

To create the project for local use, you must copy the Verilog files (.v) and
the quartus project file (.qpf) onto your local machine then open the qpf file
from you quartus environment.

I am the only contributor for this project.  All files have either been custom
made by me or auto generated using the Altera Company's licensed software, 
Quartus Prime v16.0.  I recognize that not all code is achieving max efficiency.
